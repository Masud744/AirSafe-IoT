# AirSafe IoT – Real-time Air & Smoke Monitoring   

An **IoT-based air quality & smoke detection system** using **ESP32 & Blynk** for real-time monitoring & instant alerts.  

## 🔹 Features  
✅ Real-time smoke detection  
✅ Instant alerts via Blynk  
✅ OLED display for local monitoring  
✅ User-friendly IoT dashboard  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **ESP32** for sensor data processing  
- **MQ-2/MQ-135** for smoke & gas detection  
- **Blynk IoT** for real-time alerts  
- **OLED Display** for local visualization  
- **Arduino IDE** for firmware development

## 📝 How It Works  
1. **ESP32** reads data from the smoke sensor.  
2. Data is sent to **Blynk IoT** for real-time monitoring.  
3. If smoke levels exceed the threshold, an **alert notification** is triggered.  
4. OLED Display shows **smoke levels & alerts**.
